# Reflection

- For this accomplishment, I largely relied on Ash's examples from class and notes I took.

* I had a couple syntax issues that I couldn't identify, but Jassica was able to help me find them.

* This task was a little difficult because codes were constantly failing and nothing was rendering.

* When I used CSS style, things didn't line up the way they should. For example, when I used 'display: flex,' it didn't work.

- When I moved vue from components into particular folders, it would sometimes update automatically in App.vue in the script setup, and when it didn't, it broke the page and I had to go in and manually adjust it.

* The entire difficulty was just things not aligning properly and malfunctioning randomly, which took hours to troubleshoot.

- FreeCodeCamp.org youtuber was quite helpful `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXpIoQ_rT_c`.

* I began to comprehend better after watching `Vue.js Course for Beginners [2021 Tutorial]` on youtube and videos and examining the class notes and lectures.
